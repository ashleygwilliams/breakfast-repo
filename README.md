> a collection of videos, recordings, and podcasts to accompany our morning coffee

there are so many cool things to learn and watch and i never seem to have the time for all of them. in an attempt to consume more of these things, i've started watching at least 1 ~20min thing every morning with my coffee.

### have a suggestion?
